Traffic Volume Prediction with Supervised ML
✅ Data preprocessing & feature engineering (time, weekdays, weekends, etc.)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (traffic patterns over hours, days, weeks)
✅ Model building with Linear Regression & Random Forest
✅ Model evaluation using RMSE & R²
✅ Visualization of actual vs predicted traffic
✅ Reflection on what the model learned about traffic behavior
✅ Sequential model (GRU) to explore deep learning for time-series prediction
